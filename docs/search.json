It’s our attempt to step back and understand why Traway worked the way it did — what patterns shaped our growth, what mistakes taught us the most, and what data quietly told us before we even realized it.\nThink of it as a post-game analysis of a startup that started in a college dorm, fought weather, bureaucracy, and bad roads, and somehow managed to build something real — all while we were still figuring out adulthood."

The Big Picture\nBetween 2022 and 2024, Traway came into picture because Students needed a way out of Kashmir that was reliable, affordable, and a way that didn’t involve twelve confusing WhatsApp groups.\nSo, we built a system. What followed were hundreds of trips, thousands of passengers, and a crash course in how messy and fascinating real operations can be.\nHere’s the quick snapshot of what those two years looked like — the heartbeat of Traway in numbers:\n\n\nShow code\n# Overall KPIs\nkpis = {\n    \"Total Trips\": len(trips),\n    \"Total Students (bookings)\": bookings[\"student_id\"].nunique(),\n    \"Total Revenue (₹)\": revenue[\"realized_revenue\"].sum().round(),\n    \"Total Cost (₹)\": revenue[\"total_cost\"].sum().round(),\n    \"Total Profit (₹)\": revenue[\"profit\"].sum().round(),\n    \"Avg Profit Margin (%)\": (revenue[\"profit\"].sum() / revenue[\"realized_revenue\"].sum() * 100).round(2),\n    \"Avg Rating (★)\": feedback[\"rating\"].mean().round(2)\n}\npd.DataFrame(kpis, index=[\"KPIs\"]).T\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPIs\n\n\n\n\nTotal Trips\n175.00\n\n\nTotal Students (bookings)\n3302.00\n\n\nTotal Revenue (₹)\n2532919.00\n\n\nTotal Cost (₹)\n2459736.00\n\n\nTotal Profit (₹)\n636017.00\n\n\nAvg Profit Margin (%)\n25.11\n\n\nAvg Rating (★)\n4.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of those numbers tells a story.

How Each Event Performed\nWhen we broke down profitability across different event batches, a pattern began to appear — and like most patterns, it came with surprises.\nSome batches, especially the early commuter runs, turned out to be quiet heroes — pulling in strong margins despite all the first-time chaos. Recreational trips, on the other hand, were less predictable: sometimes great, sometimes just enough to break even. And emergency evacuations? Those were never about profit; they were about showing up when no one else could.\nThe graph below tells that story visually — each bar a snapshot of how efficiency, timing, and chaos interacted in their own weird ways:\n\n\nShow code\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,5))\nsns.barplot(data=revenue_event, x=\"event_batch_id\", y=\"profit_margin\", hue=\"event_batch_id\", dodge=False)\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.title(\"Profit Margin by Event Batch\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Profit Margin (%)\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Event Batch\")\nplt.legend([],[],frameon=False)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Figure: Profit Margin by Event Batch)\nWhat stands out isn’t just which events made the most money — it’s how consistent the system became over time. From the trial-and-error beginnings to smoother later runs, Traway slowly learned what worked, what didn’t, and how to turn experience into efficiency.\nPerfect — these two blocks work great together. One shows how events behaved financially, the other where those results came from geographically. We’ll keep the tone analytical but human — like someone walking a reader through real outcomes, not just posting plots."

    "text": "6. The Psychology of Booking Early\nWe wanted to solve one of the most familiar problems in travel, empty seats! During Traway’s early days, we had a hunch. Whenever we warned students that fares might increase later, bookings seemed to skyrocket. When we offered discounts instead, the response was… lukewarm.\nWe didn’t know it then, but we were bumping into something behavioral economists have written books about — loss aversion. People hate losing more than they love saving.\nSo later, when we finally understood data and statistics well enough to test our instincts, we designed a small experiment. One season, we used a gain frame — “Book early and save ₹50.” Another season, a loss frame — “Book late and pay ₹50 extra.”\nSame math. Very different psychology.\nThe numbers that followed gave us a very good idea that loss aversion motivated more students to book but that was just intuition.\n\n\nShow code\n# --- Correct imports ---\nimport numpy as np\nfrom statsmodels.stats.proportion import proportions_ztest\n\n# Compute prebooking shares\nexp = bookings.groupby(\"framing_type\")[\"prebooking_flag\"].mean().reset_index()\nexp.columns = [\"framing_type\",\"prebook_rate\"]\n\n\n\nsns.barplot(data=exp, x=\"framing_type\", y=\"prebook_rate\", palette=\"Set2\", hue=\"prebook_rate\")\nplt.title(\"Prebooking Participation by Framing Type\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Prebooking Share\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Figure: Prebooking Participation by Framing Type)\nThe chart shows what we’d always sensed — the loss frame clearly outperformed the gain frame. Students responded more when they thought they might lose something rather than earn it.\nBut that was still intuition. How could we be sure it wasn’t just luck?\nNow that we actually understand data and hypothesis testing, we went back and ran a two-proportion Z-test, with the null hypothesis that both framings performed the same.\nThe result? p-value &lt; 0.05 — statistically significant. Our gut feeling from those chaotic travel seasons had been right all along. What felt like human behavior on the ground turned out to be provable psychology in the data.\n\n\nShow code\n# Sample sizes\nn_gain = bookings.query(\"framing_type == 'gain'\").shape[0]\nn_loss = bookings.query(\"framing_type == 'loss'\").shape[0]\np_gain = exp.loc[exp[\"framing_type\"]==\"gain\",\"prebook_rate\"].values[0]\np_loss = exp.loc[exp[\"framing_type\"]==\"loss\",\"prebook_rate\"].values[0]\n\n# Two-proportion Z-test\ncount = np.array([p_gain*n_gain, p_loss*n_loss])\nnobs = np.array([n_gain, n_loss])\nz, p = proportions_ztest(count, nobs, alternative=\"smaller\")  # smaller → gain&lt;loss\n\ndisplay(exp)\nprint(f\"Z-stat = {z:.3f}, p-value = {p:.4f}\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nframing_type\nprebook_rate\n\n\n\n\n0\ngain\n0.296020\n\n\n1\nloss\n0.499218\n\n\n2\nnone\n0.292218\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZ-stat = -8.619, p-value = 0.0000\n\n\n(Table: Prebooking Rate by Framing Type) The table shows it clearly — when framed as a potential loss, students booked earlier almost twice as often.

They became the heartbeat of our operations — the people who made the late nights, data cleaning, and chaos worth it.\n\n\nShow code\n# ── Monthly cohort retention (simple, usage-based)\n# Cohort = first month the student purchased; Active = months the student purchased\nfirst_month = b_paid.groupby(\"student_id\")[\"booking_month\"].min().rename(\"cohort_month\")\nactivity = b_paid.groupby([\"student_id\",\"booking_month\"])[\"trip_id\"].nunique().rename(\"active_trips\").reset_index()\nactivity = activity.merge(first_month, on=\"student_id\", how=\"left\")\nactivity[\"months_since_cohort\"] = ((activity[\"booking_month\"].dt.to_period(\"M\") - activity[\"cohort_month\"].dt.to_period(\"M\")).apply(attrgetter(\"n\")))\n\n# Cohort size\ncohort_size = activity.groupby(\"cohort_month\")[\"student_id\"].nunique().rename(\"cohort_size\").reset_index()\n\n# Active users per cohort-month\nactive_users = activity.groupby([\"cohort_month\",\"months_since_cohort\"])[\"student_id\"].nunique().reset_index()\nret = active_users.merge(cohort_size, on=\"cohort_month\", how=\"left\")\nret[\"retention_rate\"] = ret[\"student_id\"] / ret[\"cohort_size\"]\n\n# Pivot to retention matrix\nret_pivot = ret.pivot(index=\"cohort_month\", columns=\"months_since_cohort\", values=\"retention_rate\").fillna(0).round(3)\ndisplay(ret_pivot.head(12))\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,4))\nsns.heatmap(ret_pivot, annot=True, fmt=\".2f\", cmap=\"Blues\", cbar=True)\nplt.title(\"Monthly Retention by Cohort (paid bookings)\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Months since cohort start\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Cohort month\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmonths_since_cohort\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n\n\ncohort_month\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2022-11-01\n1.0\n0.000\n0.026\n0.035\n0.148\n0.000\n0.017\n0.078\n0.217\n0.000\n0.148\n0.165\n0.174\n0.296\n0.000\n0.017\n0.017\n\n\n2022-12-01\n1.0\n0.037\n0.039\n0.083\n0.000\n0.048\n0.074\n0.268\n0.000\n0.124\n0.140\n0.178\n0.363\n0.000\n0.008\n0.033\n0.000\n\n\n2023-01-01\n1.0\n0.034\n0.069\n0.000\n0.017\n0.121\n0.276\n0.000\n0.086\n0.190\n0.207\n0.414\n0.000\n0.017\n0.017\n0.000\n0.000\n\n\n2023-02-01\n1.0\n0.065\n0.000\n0.076\n0.076\n0.250\n0.000\n0.152\n0.120\n0.185\n0.315\n0.000\n0.022\n0.022\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n\n\n2023-03-01\n1.0\n0.000\n0.053\n0.065\n0.231\n0.000\n0.083\n0.172\n0.154\n0.355\n0.000\n0.012\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n\n\n2023-05-01\n1.0\n0.040\n0.307\n0.000\n0.107\n0.187\n0.200\n0.373\n0.000\n0.013\n0.067\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n\n\n2023-06-01\n1.0\n0.099\n0.000\n0.138\n0.138\n0.204\n0.395\n0.000\n0.013\n0.013\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n\n\n2023-07-01\n1.0\n0.000\n0.102\n0.172\n0.187\n0.351\n0.000\n0.010\n0.017\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n\n\n2023-09-01\n1.0\n0.072\n0.192\n0.312\n0.000\n0.008\n0.016\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n\n\n2023-10-01\n1.0\n0.194\n0.318\n0.000\n0.008\n0.031\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n\n\n2023-11-01\n1.0\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.026\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n\n\n2023-12-01\n1.0\n0.000\n0.010\n0.042\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Figure: Monthly Retention by Cohort (paid bookings))\nAnd when we zoom out across time, the cohort map shows how retention evolved month to month. Each blue cell is a memory of students returning — or not — as semesters passed, seasons changed, and we learned how to serve better.\nIn the end, loyalty wasn’t luck or marketing. It was earned, one on-time trip, one answered call, one safe arrival at a time.
