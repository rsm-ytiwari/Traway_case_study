### *What began as a way home became our way forward.*

Back in 2022, three students at **NIT Srinagar** (me included) were just trying to get home for vacation.
Flights were too expensive, cabs were chaotic, and the highway out of Kashmir felt like an obstacle course with cliffs on both sides.
So, we did what any group of mildly desperate, overly confident students would do — we built our own system.



## **The Accidental Startup**

It started as a WhatsApp group and a Google Form.
Then came late-night spreadsheets, phone calls with bus operators, and our first 50 students heading home safely.
Next thing we knew, Traway was a **registered travel company** with a **React-Django** platform, QR-coded tickets, and over **3,000 passengers** moved across **7,000+ trips** — all bootstrapped and run by a team of students who were also cramming for finals.



## **The Data Phase (a.k.a. when we learned what a “KPI” was)**

Running buses in Kashmir isn’t exactly plug-and-play.
We collected data on everything — costs, routes, feedback, refunds, delays, satisfaction — and built our first dashboards using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.

That’s when we discovered that:

* Profit margins weren’t random; they were about timing and predictability.
* Students didn’t respond to discounts — they responded to **loss aversion** (“Book late and pay extra!” worked better than “Book early and save”).
* Reliability sold better than cheapness.

Somewhere between the code and the chaos, we became analysts, not just founders.



## **What We Learned (the hard way, mostly)**

* **Validate before building.** Ideas are easy; full buses are hard.
* **Measure everything.** Feelings are great, but data doesn’t lie.
* **Trust compounds.** Every on-time bus was a marketing campaign that cost ₹0.



## **What Happened After**

After about two years, we realized we’d built something that worked — just not something that could easily scale beyond Kashmir.
So we wound it down gracefully and used everything we learned to start **The Loud Kitchens**, our next venture.

Traway taught us how to run operations in chaos, think in data, and make real things happen without waiting for permission.
