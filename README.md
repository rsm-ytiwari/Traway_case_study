# Background

Traway didn’t begin in a boardroom — it began in a hostel room, with three students trying to figure out how to get home.

At NIT Srinagar, every semester break felt like a small crisis: thousands of students from across India trying to leave a region, for their homes, with no railway, limited flights, and unpredictable highways. Their was no system built for us, so we had to build our own.

We were three co-founders — Rohit, Rahi, and I (Yash) — who decided that if logistics in Kashmir couldn’t be solved top-down, we’d start from the ground up. What began as a WhatsApp group + Google Form turned into a structured, event-based travel network that moved thousands of students safely across states.

As the wheels started turning, our team grew — Pratyush, Vinayak, Gowtham, Vansh, massive shout-out to them, they helped Traway grow its reach and then soon after a group of passionate juniors joined in, helping with operations, communication, and coordination on the ground. And through it all, we were guided by Asst. Prof. Noor Zaman Khan and Assoc. Saad Parvez — mentors whose trust and encouragement kept us steady when things looked impossible. What started as three people soon became a 10+ member student-led company, running a system that somehow worked despite every reason it shouldn’t in a volatile region like kashmir.

Traway was more than a startup, it was our first experiment in thinking like entrepreneurs. We learned to plan under uncertainty, take calculated risks, and make decisions when there wasn’t enough data yet — the same mindset that fuels every founder’s first venture.

Looking back, we realized that what we once labeled as failures were actually the moments that taught us how to build better, think sharper, and lead with resilience. They weren’t setbacks — they were our earliest successes, just disguised as lessons and we this report we ain to share those learnings with you, the reader, This report isn’t just about routes, numbers, or margins — it’s about how a small group of students built a working system out of chaos and learned the fundamentals of business, leadership, and risk the hard way — by actually doing it.
